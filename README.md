# Music-Player


I undertook this project in the framework of my training as a cloud developer. Having skills in web development is mandatory nowadays. This work aimed to learn us how Javascrip could be useful to dynamise a static website.
Without Javascript, my music player could simply not function.
I have added some pleasant French piece of art, (Charles Aznavour, Edith Piaf) and some international famous songs.
